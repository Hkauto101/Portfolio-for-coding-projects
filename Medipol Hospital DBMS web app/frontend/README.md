# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Make sure to install Node.js and npm

Before running any React frontend application, you need to install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your system.
Node.js Installation:

Windows:

1: Visit nodejs.org

2: Download the LTS (Long Term Support) version for Windows
Run the installer (.msi file) and follow the installation wizard
Restart your computer after installation

3: Verify installation by opening Command Prompt and running:

run the following:

node --version
npm --version


macOS:

1: Visit nodejs.org
2: Download the LTS version for macOS
3: Run the installer (.pkg file) and follow the instructions

## Install dependencies on your local project folder using `npm install`

Step 1: Navigate to Project Directory

Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to your React project folder:

Windows (Command Prompt/PowerShell):
run this: cd C:\path\to\your\"react-project"

macOS/Linux (Terminal):
cd /path/to/your/"react-project"

Step 2: Install Dependencies

npm install (this will install a folder called node-modules on your project folder which will then allow you to deploy your react frontend)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Put directory to frontend PATH of the project folder:

run: cd /path/to/your/"react-project"/frontend
then: npm start


This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
